Algorithm for Binary to gray - Abhinav

Step1: Start
Step2: Load the first 16bit binary number in location 0x40000000 (pointed by R4)
Step3: initialize loop counter ariable, say i, to number of binary numbers in the array
Step4: Repeat until i!=0,
	 Mask higher significant 16bits by AND operation with 0000FFFF, and store in R0
	 Store this halfword binary in memory location pointed by R4
	 Right shift this binary number by 1 bit, and store in R10
	 Ex-OR operate R0 and R10, to get corresponding Gray number
	Store it in memory location pointed by R3
     decrement i by 1
Step5: Stop
