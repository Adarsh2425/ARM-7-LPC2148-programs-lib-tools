Algorithm for evaluating given equation with conditions

Step1: Start
Step2: Load x,y in registers R7,R8 resp.
Step3: if x > y, skip to step9

Step4: Load coefficents a,b,c of ay^2+bx+c in R2,R1,R0 resp.
Step5:  Multiply a with (y multiplied with y)
Step6:	Multiply b with x
Step7:	Add a*y^2,b*x,c and store in R10
Step8:  Skip to step13

Step9:	Load coefficents a,b,c of ax^2+by+c in R2,R1,R0 resp.
Step10:	Multiply a with (x multiplied with x)
Step11:	Multiply b with y
Step12:	Add a*x^2, b*y, c and store in R10
Step13:	Stop
