Repository containing keil project file and proteus simulation file for a Digital clock design using LPC2138/48

This projects aims to design a basic digital clock using ARMv7 based micro-controller (LPC2148/LPC2138) 
and interface it with display and Bluetooth module for alarm and medicine reminder features.

The designed digital clock has a LCD for displaying the time and date. 
The clock has alarm feature. For people who forget to take their medication it is a very useful thing to have a reminder. 
The medicine reminder feature will display the message to take medicine on LCD and also it will send the same message over Bluetooth.

Motivation is the reason for people's actions, willingness and goals. 
My motivation to work on this project came from the fact that we see a a lot interesting gadgets around us all the time. 
But being an embedded systems enthusiast I always wanted to design such a gadget myself. So I made a digital clock with all the basic features. 
This device is no way near industrial standard, but it surely have helped me to apply the concepts I have learned to use in real life.
